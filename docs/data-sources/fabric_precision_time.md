- `advance_configuration` (Block, Read-only) An object that has advanced configuration options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--advance_configuration))
- `connections` (Block List) An array of objects with unique identifiers of connections. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--connections))
- `description` (String) Optional description of time service
- `href` (String) Equinix generated Portal link for the created Precision Time Service
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the resource
- `ipv4` (Block Set) An object that has Network IP Configurations for Timing Master Servers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ipv4))
- `name` (String) Name of Precision Time Service. Applicable values: Maximum: 24 characters; Allowed characters: alpha-numeric, hyphens ('-') and underscores ('_')
- `package` (Block Set) Precision Time Service Package Details (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--package))
- `project` (Block Set) An object that contains the Equinix Fabric project_id used for linking the Time Precision Service to a specific Equinix Fabric Project (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--project))
- `state` (String) Indicator of the state of this Precision Time Service. One of: [[PROVISIONED PROVISIONING PROVISIONING_FAILED CONFIGURING CANCELLED DEPROVISIONING_FAILED PENDING_CONFIGURATION DEPROVISIONED CONFIGURING_FAILED DEPROVISIONING]]
- `type` (String) Choose type of Precision Time Service

<a id="nestedblock--account"></a>
### Nested Schema for `account`

Read-Only:

- `account_number` (Number) Equinix User account number
- `global_org_id` (String) Equinix User global organization id
- `is_reseller_account` (Boolean) Equinix User Boolean flag indicating if it is a reseller account
- `org_id` (String) Equinix User organization id


<a id="nestedblock--advance_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `advance_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `ntp` (List of Object) Advance Configuration for NTP; a list of MD5 objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--advance_configuration--ntp))
- `ptp` (Block, Read-only) An object that has advanced PTP configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--advance_configuration--ptp))

<a id="nestedatt--advance_configuration--ntp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `advance_configuration.ntp`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
- `password` (String)
- `type` (String)


<a id="nestedblock--advance_configuration--ptp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `advance_configuration.ptp`

Read-Only:

- `domain` (Number) Represents the domain number associated with the PTP profile. This is used to differentiate multiple PTP networks within a single physical network.
- `grant_time` (Number) Unicast Grant Time in seconds. For Multicast and Hybrid transport modes, grant time defaults to 300 seconds. For Unicast mode, grant time can be between 30 to 7200.
- `log_announce_interval` (Number) Represents the log2 interval between consecutive PTP announce messages. For example, a value of 0 implies an interval of 2^0 = 1 second.
- `log_delay_req_interval` (Number) Represents the log2 interval between consecutive PTP delay request messages. A value of 0 implies an interval of 2^0 = 1 second.
- `log_sync_interval` (Number) Represents the log2 interval between consecutive PTP synchronization messages. A value of 0 implies an interval of 2^0 = 1 second.
- `priority_1` (Number) Specifies the priority level 1 for the clock. The value helps in determining the best clock in the PTP network. Lower values are considered higher priority.
- `priority_2` (Number) Specifies the priority level 2 for the clock. It acts as a tie-breaker if multiple clocks have the same priority 1 value. Lower values are considered higher priority.
- `time_scale` (String) Time scale value. ARB denotes Arbitrary, and PTP denotes Precision Time Protocol.
- `transport_mode` (String) Mode of transport for the Time Precision Service.
