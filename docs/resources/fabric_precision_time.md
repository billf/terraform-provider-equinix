# equinix_fabric_precision_time (Resource)

Fabric V4 API compatible resource allows creation and management of Equinix Fabric Precision Time Services

Additional documentation:
* Getting Started: https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Edge-Services/EPT/EPT.htm
* API: https://developer.equinix.com/dev-docs/fabric/api-reference/fabric-v4-apis#precision-time

## Example Usage

PTP Configuration:
```terraform
